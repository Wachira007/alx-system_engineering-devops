Issue Summary: On February 2nd, 2023, a critical outage was experienced in the web stack of a sample application from 10:30 AM to 11:45 AM (EAT). During this time, the web application was inaccessible to all users, causing a 100% disruption to the service. The root cause of the issue was traced to a failure in the database server.
Timeline:
•	10:30 AM: The issue was detected by a monitoring alert that showed a spike in response time for the web application.
•	10:35 AM: The alert was reviewed by a software engineer, who immediately started investigating the issue.
•	10:40 AM: Initial investigation suggested a network connectivity issue between the web server and the database server.
•	10:45 AM: The network connectivity issue was ruled out after further investigation, and the focus shifted to the database server.
•	10:50 AM: The issue was escalated to the database administrator, who joined the investigation.
•	11:00 AM: The database administrator discovered a disk space issue on the database server, causing the database to crash.
•	11:15 AM: The disk space issue was resolved, and the database server was restarted.
•	11:30 AM: The web application was tested and found to be functioning normally.
•	11:45 AM: The incident was officially declared resolved, and a post-mortem meeting was scheduled for the following day.
Root cause and resolution: The root cause of the outage was traced to a disk space issue on the database server. The database server ran out of disk space, causing the database to crash. The database administrator resolved the issue by freeing up disk space on the server and restarting the database.
Corrective and preventive measures:
•	Regular monitoring of disk space usage on the database server to avoid future outages.
•	Implementing a disk space alert system to automatically notify the database administrator in case of low disk space.
•	Implementing a database backup and recovery system to ensure data integrity and availability in case of unexpected outages.
•	Regularly reviewing and updating the capacity planning for the database server to ensure it can handle future growth.
•	Training the database administrator on the best practices for managing disk space usage on the database server.
